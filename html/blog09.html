                      <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Intro</h2>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">As an avid laptop enthusiast, I’m aware of the large amount of information needed in order to evaluate the value of a laptop. Because of that, many companies created marketing terms without much of a meaning so that they could oversell products with features that you don’t need, or seem more important than they really are.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Despite many companies participating in these practices, there’s a laptop from a new startup company that has went against all of that. Even though it is still only available in America and certain parts of Europe, I still believe it’s capable enough to reach out worldwide.</p>
                      <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Framework</h2>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">The Framework laptop from the company with the same name, is the first ever computer with full repairability and upgradability. That’s their biggest selling point because no computer has been able to do that, and not because of their inability to do so, but simply because it’s hard to generate high profit, which is understandable. But that just makes the Framework laptop more interesting.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Many other laptops can also be upgraded with RAM, SSD, wifi card, etc… But with the Framework laptop, you can also upfrade the CPU and GPU: the 2 things that usually differentiate 2 laptops between a year in the same lineup. This is really important because lately many manufacturers have reported a low shortage of laptop components.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">That’s why being able to upgrade your laptop power while still keeping remaning components that can last much longer can save a lot on not only your money, but also the environment.</p>
                      <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Perks</h2>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Another trend that Framework has decided to go against was the amount of ports. Many laptops nowadays don’t include many ports, and some even require you to bring a dongle along just so you can do your work. It is true that USB-C is a convenient port for both charging and using mordern accessories, and adding too many ports just make the laptop more thick and heavier, which goes against today’s minimalistic approach.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">So Framework still uses USB-C, but rather than requiring you to bring a dongle along, they include “dongles” that attaches to the ports but is doesn’t stick out from the laptop’s rectangle form.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">With it’s full repairability and freedom to customize, it could be a really thick computer. But Framework engineered them to be slim like a normal laptop, and the design is modern with just a single logo on the laptop’s cover.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">This feature only benefits more technical people, but having them is something really beneficial if you can take advantage of it. Almost all companies have proprietary softwares or firmwares, locking you from modifying them. But framework offers complete open-source software with GNU license that opens for everyone to look at.</p>
                      <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Price</h2>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">With features not only friendly to end users, but allows enthusiasts to customize them, this is a perfect laptop with almost no downside for most people. But because of it’s anti-corporate features, the laptop costs a lot higher than it’s competition. But if you can afford it, then that’s a worthwhile price to pay for complete freedom.</p>
                      <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Outro</h2>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Though not that big, and not really noticed by many people outside of America, I hope this product will raise enough awareness about the bad practises computer manufaturers nowadays are doing.</p>
