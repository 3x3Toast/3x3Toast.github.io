                      <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Intro</h2>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Throughout my life until now, I’ve tried many different kinds of transportation. From daily commuting using bicycles, to traveling long distances using planes. All of them have given me some kind of memory or appreciation. But there’s one particular means of transportation that tops everything else.</p>
                      <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Bicycle</h2>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Before getting into my most favourite transportation, I’d like to evaluate the others in order to understand why I chose it.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Back in middle school, because school was really close to my house, I always commuted by bicycle. Not only could I exercise and be healthier while going to school, I could also detour to view the calming and relaxing scenery of dawn. </p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Being able to control my commute time is something I really like. When there’s something I need for a school assignment, or when there’s a new release of a book that I really like, I could go there at a moment’s notice without having to rely on anything.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">But cycling takes a lot of strength, and when you’re mentally tired, especially in Vietnam’s traffic, it usually doesn’t end well. I’ve taken myself into many near-accidents and sometimes actual accidents that got me scars and sometimes even broke my bike. So when I was in a bad mood, cycling would feel like a hindrance and I couldn’t be able to go home or go to anywhere I want.</p>
                      <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Bus</h2>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Nowadays, because of the long distance of 22km from my house to school, I have to commute by bus. Many of my friends think badly of buses, as they are infamous of their reckless driving and horrible service. And it’s true. They’re slow, sometimes the a/c doesn’t even work, and a small mistake could lead to a shouting from the conductor. There’s also an ongoing problem among us. Though rarely, I’d encounter some groomers there and there was one incident that still traumatizes me until now. But this is a societal issue so I don’t blame it too much on the bus.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Although I would take any other means of transportation if possible, there are still upsides to buses. Not having to drive, and viewing the road outside while listening to music without a worry before getting to school is really a mood for me. And when it rains, I don’t have to worry about driving or getting too wet.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">I usually take a really small bus with little to no people, and recently, Vinbus, so they’re really consistent with their service and driving. But others may vary and sometimes my mood is ruined. But that’s okay, and the upside somewhat balances out the downside.</p>
                      <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">My most favourite means of transportation </h2>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">I don’t exactly have this transportation at my disposal, but I got to experience it and it really left an impression on me.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Motorcycles are fast, easy to drive, and for my preference in being able to actively control my time while taking as little energy as possible, motorcycles just seem perfect for my use-case.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">For me, it’s an all-rounder that lets me drive fast when I’m in a hurry, drive slowly when I just want to experience the ride, and most importantly, backpacking. Because of my current situation, traveling far isn’t really an option. But I’ve longed for it enough to be sure that I want to go backpacking all over Vietnam and take cool pictures.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Most of the upsides listed before from my other transportations also applies to motcycle. And with the addition of being able to travel long distance, there’s nothing for me to complain about. The only downside that I wouldn’t even consider bad since it’s part of our culture is the traffic and the possibility of getting into an accident. But that’s what insurance is for.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">My reasons to like motorcycles are mostly theoretical since I don’t have one myself and don’t know much of the downside of it before actually getting one myself. But having favourites is purely opinionated, and it’s always good to dream of something to distract you from the cold reality of life.</p>
