                      <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Intro</h2>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">I’m a kind of person to always do research beforehand because I don’t believe in buying something only based on the employee’s recommendation. That’s why most experiences I have with services don’t have many social interactions. Because I always know what I’m buying, making me impressed in a service is really hard. But when a service achieves that, it makes me feel happier and use them more frequently.</p>
                      <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Restaurant</h2>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Back in Secondary school I took an IT course. I only had to go there thrice a week. But it went from 18 o’clock to 21 o’clock. So I didn’t have much time to eat dinner, and had to eat at Lotteria - a fast food restaurant nearby.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">As unhealthy as it seems, I was actually underweight because of my height growth, so eating like this didn’t affect much. On the first time of going there, the place was obviously empty with maybe just 1 or 2 customers because it was late. By the time I got there it was already half past 21. </p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">I chose a combo with fries, a burger, a chicken piece and soda. I didn’t expect much since I thought they’d probably just give me the leftovers. But the cashier asked me if I was willing to wait a bit longer for the chicken because they had to make a new batch. Getting newly made fried chicken at almost anytime of the day is actually really hard, so I said yes.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">It took about 15 minutes, and I got my meal. Everything was steaming hot, and the meal was delicious. I knew that the store closes at 10 o’clock, but the vibe there was still very chill. It was just me and some fast food workers talking to each other.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">I couldn’t just eat the same meal from the same restaurant, but it left a good impression on me in terms of the food quality. So I decided to eat there every Monday.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">The food quality was still good, and the workers there even started to notice me. I didn’t talk much with them, but they were attentive. Whenever there was a promotion, they’d tell me about it, and even save some of the gifts included. Sometimes they even prepared the chickens beforehand so that I didn’t have to wait.</p>
                      <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Outro</h2>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">But my studying course ended and I couldn’t eat there anymore. I talked to them about it. They gave one last farewell and I got back home. I really missed the calming nights, and especially the services there too. A lot of time have passed, and I doubt the old workers there are still around. But I’d still like to try to eat there again.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">The place is on Trung Kinh street, I don’t know much about the services on the other time of the day, but at night, it is definitely a place worth eating at.</p>
