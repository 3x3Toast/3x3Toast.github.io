                      <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Intro</h2>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">If you’ve been to a city in Vietnam before, there’s something that will definitely leave an impression on you, and that’s the horrendous traffic.</p>
                      <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Problems</h2>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">I live in Long Bien, and the only way to go to central Hanoi or any other district is through Vinh Tuy or Chuong Duong bridge. And on those bridges, accidents can happen and you’ll be stuck there for atleast 30 minutes. Not only that, on rush hours, you’re not only stuck on the bridge, but after getting out of the bridge the road after that would also be crowded.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">I understand the fact that the 2 areas are seperated by the Red river, and building bridges is the only choice. Bridges are fine, but the big problem besides accidents is the lane. Just before the building of a new bridge next to Vinh Tuy bridge, there were 3 merging lanes, and 2 currently. When people go up bridge they usually go on high speed. Now when 2 other vehicles goes into your lane, you’d have to slow down, making the other vehicles behind you also slow down, and the one after that, making a chain until it becomes a bottleneck. And there’s also a spur route that has the same effect of creating a bottleneck.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Chuong Duong bridge is a little bit more problematic because it leads to central Hanoi and many tourist attractions. And it is also close to Long Bien bridge which is also another attraction.</p>
                      <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Hotspots</h2>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">That’s just Long Bien alone, other areas that have schools or tourist atractions are also affected by high traffic. Xuan Thuy street, La Thanh street, beltway no. 3. They’re all differently structured, but still has the same problem.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">La Thanh street has too many alleyways and the road is really small. Xuan Thuy street though fine, still has 4 schools built right next to each other including 1 more nearby. Some other streets with unfinished constructions make parts of the road smaller than it should be, forcing vehicles to merge lanes and create a bottleneck.</p>
                      <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">People</h2>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">People’s behaviour is another big factor. You’d think that doing passing a red light, or pass another vehicle by going on an opposite lane sometimes makes it better because you’re escaping traffic faster. But it creates a chain effect creating a possibility of traffic jam when there’re many vehicles close to each other. </p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Driving on a side walk creates a merge point where other vehicles on the main road has to slow down for you to enter the road again. Going on an opposite lane makes vehicles on the opposite lane have to avoid you, and when you enter your lane again, the vehicles on that lane have to also slow down for you to enter.</p>
                      <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Possible solutions</h2>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Some places are unfortunately hard to fix like La Thanh street with complicated and small roads. But places with unfinished constructions could just be finished. Rather than splitting fundings or create new construction plans we should focus on one at a time.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Expanding roads isn’t realistic since it takes a lot of time and effort but doesn’t have a great impact. But creating multiple entries into hotspots like schools with multiple big roads leading there is a good solution.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">You can also build overpasses for big intersections, but only if the road is big enough to create spacing for vehicles to enter the bridge.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Finally, the biggest problem that is the hardest to fix, is our behaviour. One of the reasons for people to violate traffic laws is frustration. Long red light, slow vehicles, people entering lanes, etc… There’re many solutions to this, but in the end, it’s just telling people to “be better”, and that’s just impossible.</p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Instead of trying to fix people, we can offer them alternatives like better public transportation, bigger sidewalks for walkability.</p>
