                      <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Intro</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Going outside has become less and less popular as there is not really much of a reason to go outside. With the advancement of the internet of things, we are constantly connected to each other virtually. The pandemic has also affected a lot to our way of living, everything can now be ordered online, many online colleges growing more and more, working from home is also possible, and most of the people who are close to you probably already have at least one social media account. </p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Without much of a reason to go outside anymore, many young people would rarely go outside and engage in outdoor activities, making others think that the current generation is getting “weaker”.  Then what are the reasons which led to the decline of that?</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Indoor activities</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">In a <a target="_blank" href="https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/50421566/Physical_activity_of_young_people_The_Am20161119-30246-4awq2q-libre.pdf?1479583590=&response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DPhysical_activity_of_young_people_the_Am.pdf&Expires=1684758037&Signature=Hb2FKWqHvEaQlR4m1iTKGl-0gkb-79i8hIGqyV8lECuj1lvw~nYcrvlCVEYCqatXehPtN7raldS9pFqoXXtBrTm0oZMjFlpSTOreXE7hcFvTDFt38OwKuijpFmaWmhCSrxb0XAi4UCsMfy-v~zS4XTePkjJEGU8deeoaahVkJRhBrGTRRwohqkFKKnbUGWAz2Zcizi7s5tABSn2cMQZcM3WrHJo0jgFDlbV6VNqXfhmHjlalpQrnslVupEYhfUDZq0NpGz8iKP3F267EF6QYqffK~FhJ1~b3VtzcLkrA5RBw0KT0TxQsGGjaoxrMJNdh3vomEgrp2eI5jHK1CD1v8w__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA">research about people participating in physical activities</a>, We can see a heavy decline in people doing them, and even less in doing vigorous activities.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">With the huge spike of urbanization in high population density, there really isn’t much space for us to work with, therefore many activities are restricted or are too unappealing to participate in.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">But on the contrary, many indoor activity facilities such as gyms were built as an alternative to outdoor activities. Because of the limited time, gyms were made for us to be more productive in physical appearance, making it more productive and less time-consuming. Treadmills, weights, dumbells, training bells, etc… Not only that the equipments could be an alternative to many outdoor activities, those equipments are also possible for you to buy and use it in your own home.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Other indoor activity facilities such as trampoline parks, indoor rockclimbing, even many buildings were made for sports such as volleyball, basketball, football, etc… are growing more and more for us to engage in without much of a hassle.</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Influence</h2>
                        <div class="row">
                          <div class="col-7">
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">No longer having to be outside in order to engage in outdoor activities, it is truly more convenient and helps us a lot in turning an activity into a habitual one without worrying about your area turing into another construction zone.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Despite the convenience indoor activity facilities provide, it’s still not a perfect replacement to outdoor activities. Being outside gives you way much more space and freedom to work with. The facilities are frequented by the young people a lot, but the diversity in the environment to execise in is taken away, making it less appealing. And also because the activities aren’t easily found outside, unless you’re having an interest the activity, it would be hard for you to be exposed to these kind of facilities or activities.</p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Even though we still don’t have a perfect solution for the current generation to engage more frequently in physical activities yet, I think that if we could make physical activites more accessible through means such as games or VR. We can even tackle this problem directly with making roads more accessible for walking and cycling so that people would be more motivated to go out using those means.</p>
