                      <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Intro</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Just like how you put up different kinds of clothes for different occasions, many people also use clothes as a way to convey who they are. Like how aristocrats in the past wear purple clothings in order to express their wealth, or businessmen wearing suits to make them seems more reliable and professional. Clothes are made for numerous reasons other than look, but ultimately, they’re still something that leave the biggest impression on what kind of person you are.</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Athletic</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Athletic people only wear things that are comfortable. Which is understand able, since they’re always drenched in sweat when execising. Sportswear is what they usually wear. </p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">For normal execising, tracksuits are preferred. But when playing sports or getting into intense training, clothes with as little cloth as possible such as shorts, polo shirts, or tanktops are the most optimal. This type of clothes offers good ventilation and is really thin.</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Street fashion</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">This type of clothes is the most diverse one, with the primary purpose of looking trendy and “hip”. They’re actually just casual clothes but altered a bit to make you look “out of the ordinary”. If you just look at the form alone, then at the barebone, most are just jeans with some type of T-shirt and sometimes an overcoat.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">But what seperates them from casual clothes are the vibrant colour, exotic pattern and art and the extra accessories. Most don’t follow a certain “suit” and are made to be standalone, but the essence of streetwear is the ability to mix and match them.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">Because of how unique it is from other kind of clothes that are made with a purpose, this kind of clothes attracts a lot of young people and people who wants to dabble into the world of fashion.</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Classic</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">In the corporate world, most people just wear suits with maybe a tie in order to bring an uniformity and professionalism to the company. But with entrepreneurs, suits make them seem too serious and are hard to open up to clients. So a classic style is perfect to make them look professional and reliable, but not too tense to make the customer comfortable.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">For a classic style they’d wear khakis for men or pencil skirts for women, with a button up shirt under a blazer. The style’s colours are beige or brown, both colours are pretty tame and gives out a sturdy and consistent feeling.</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" style="color: black;">Outro</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="color: black;">They’re still many more kinds of clothes out there for each person to pick and choose. And caring about what you’re wearing, not for others, but for yourself, or your own benefits, is also a way to love yourself, or bring your personality our there to the busy world of over 8 billion people.</p>
